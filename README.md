NoCap
=====

BigRedHacks project.

NoCap is a different approach to experiencing your photos, again and again. 
We take away the clutter of tagging, the adding of filters, the buttons for a million different functions you don't really need. 
Here, we give you two: a button to upload, and a button to view your gallery. 
We take care of the presentation, using state-of-the-art methods to collage your photos beautifully and responsively.
At NoCap we sincerely believe that each picture is worth at least a thousand words, 
and that they should speak for themselves, without the aid of captions. 
We aim to give an intimate, personalized gallery that you can add to at any time, anywhere.
